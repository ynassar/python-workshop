# Write a python program to get the counts of each file extension in the data directory.

# Import the os module to be able to access os commands.

# Create a dictionary that maps each file extension to it's count.

# Use the os.listdir() function to get a list of files.

# For each file, extract it's extension and increment the corresponding count.
