# Create a program that reads a csv file that contains the name of a list of employees, along with their salaries,
# and takes as input an employee's name, and prints that employee's salary.

# Create a dict "salary" that maps employee names to their salaries.

# Open the file using open() and a with: statement.

# Iterate over the lines of the file.

# Split the lines by comma and fill the dict accordingly.
