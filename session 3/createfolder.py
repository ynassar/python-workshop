# Our goal now is to write a function that creates a folder inside a base directory with a name,
# but only if that name does not exist.

# To accomplish this, we use the os module once again. We use two main functions, os.path.exists(), and os.mkdir().
# We use os.path.exists() to check whether the directory exists, if it does not, we create it.
