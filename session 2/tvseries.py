# Create a python program to organize tv-series files. These files are organized arbitrarily inside the 'data' directory.
# We'd like to create a directory for each series, and a directory within for each season.

# Install the guessit module using pip. This will be used to parse our filenames.
# Import both the guessit module and the os module.

# Use os.walk() and/or os.listdir() to get the names of all files in the data directory.
# Then, using the guessit.guessit() function, extract the information about the file and put into the corresponding folder.
