# Compute the interest that the bank will give you for n years at a certain interest rate on a given investment.
# The total amount in the account after n years is : initial * (1 + interest) ^ n
# The interest paid by the bank is then total - initial

# To input a value from the user we use input() (but this gives us a string!).
# Assign the inputted value of n, initial, and interest to variables.

# Compute the total amount. In python, a^x is written as a**x.

# Compute the interest amount.

# Output the answer.
