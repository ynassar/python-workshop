# Write a python program to print the primes from 0 to 100 squared. The primes from 0 to 100 are as follows:
# [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]

# Create the appropriate Python list.

primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]

# Use a For loop to iterate over the primes, and print each prime.

#    for (int i = 0; i < adsada; i ++)
#       cout << primes[i] << endl;

for prime in primes:
    print(prime ** 2)
