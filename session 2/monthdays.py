# Write a program to take the name of a month and print the number of days in it.
# The number of days per month are as follows:
#  { 'January' : 31,
#     'February' : 28,
#     'March' : 31,
#     'April' : 30,
#     'May' : 31,
#     'June' : 30,
#     'July' : 31,
#     'August' : 31,
#     'September' : 30,
#     'October' : 31,
#     'November' : 30,
#     'December' : 31
#     }


# Create a python "dict" num_days the maps the name of the month to the # of days. i.e. num_days['January'] = 31, etc..

# Input the name of the month from the user.

# Print the corresponding num_days.
